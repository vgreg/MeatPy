        Project Description
        -------------------
        
        The goal of this project is to provide a standard framework for processing and 
        analysing high-frequency financial data.
        
        
        MeatPy currently supports Nasdaq ITCH 5.0. It can easily be adapted to process event-time data from multiple financial exchanges
        and formats.
